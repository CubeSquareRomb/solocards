## The powerful tool for self-studying

This app can help you memorize any kind of topic. The unit of the information is represented as a flashcard, which contains just a question and an answer. For example, if you want to learn historical dates, just create multiple cards for each date, like _"What's the year of the independence of the USA? - 1776"_. Even during the process of making cards, you're studying. Then, you can play one of the four modes:

* **Training mode** - you just need to think about the answer before showing the real answer
* **Option mode** - you have 4 options, and you need to choose the correct one
* **Writing mode** - you need to write the correct answer using the keyboard
* **True/False mode** - you need to give a true or false answer to a given statement

Advice: The quiz (list of cards) should have similar flashcards, for example, if the quiz is about dates, the cards should include only dates
